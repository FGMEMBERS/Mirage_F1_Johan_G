Contact information

For those of you who are around on the FlightGear forum[5] I can be found

in contact.  Be aware that I sometimes do not check my e-mail for some time.
Please mention "FlightGear" and "Mirage F1" in the subject line.

I might at times be on the FlightGear IRC channels as Johan_G or in
multiplayer usually as SE-JG.  As for my time zone I live in UTC+1 in winter
and UTC+2 in summer.


As for feature requests, do not expect anything to happen, but feel
free to ask.  ;-)
